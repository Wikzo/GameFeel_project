\section{Experimental Design} \label{experimentalDesign}
\subsection{Research Question}
How does the acceleration and deceleration of a player avatar influence the game feel of a 2D platformer? What types of words do players use to describe the game feeling, and what parameters result in these words?

\subsection{Stimuli}
The time it took for the player avatar to accelerate and decelerate changed between rounds.

\subsection{Stimulus Presentation}
Participants played four rounds of the game. Each round had different acceleration and deceleration times. All other elements were held constant, i.e., the level design and parameters for jumping. Between rounds, participants were asked to describe how it felt to play the game. The term \textit{game feel} was explicitly not explained, so that participants would try to describe the feel of the game from their own understanding of what game feel is.

The experiment was designed as a repeated-measures, within-participant design \cite{cunningham}. This means that the participants will be exposed to the stimuli (the changing acceleration and deceleration) multiple times. Additionally, each participant will see all of the available stimuli (each combination within the two time categories fast and slow), thereby acting as their own control group by comparing the different stimuli to each other.

\subsubsection{Latin Squares} \label{latinSection}
There are four possible combinations, as shown in Table \ref{tab:combinations}. One of the strengths with within-participant designs is that it doesn't require as many participants as a between-participant design, since each participant will try all the conditions. However, one disadvantage of within-participant designs is the risk of carry-over effects \cite{experimental1}. This might be due to fatigue (e.g., the participants become bored after having experienced the multiple conditions) or practice (e.g., the participants are better at the end than when they started).

\begin{table} \centering
\caption{Four different combinations.}
\label{tab:combinations}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
& \textbf{Acceleration} & \textbf{Deceleration} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Stimulus 1} & Fast (A) & Fast (A)\\
\textbf{Stimulus 2} & Slow (B) & Slow (B)\\
\textbf{Stimulus 3} & Fast (A) & Slow (B)\\
\textbf{Stimulus 4} & Slow (B) & Fast (A)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The order in which the different stimuli are shown can affect the participant's behaviour.  A way to prevent this is to use a counter-balanced design. This method reduces the chances of the order influencing the results \cite{experimental2}. Ideally, since there are four possible conditions (see Table \ref{tab:combinations}), there should be 4x3x2x1 different orders, i.e., 24 orders of treatment. The number of participants must also be a multiple of 24, since there should be an equal number in each group \cite{experimental2}. Having 24 different combinations was deemed too complex; thus, an incomplete balanced design in the form of Latin squares has been used instead (see Table \ref{table:latin}). Even though the order effects aren't eliminated completely, they become balanced. Latin squares are arranged in rows and columns such that each of the stimuli conditions only occur once in each row and column. For experiments with an even number of conditions, the first row of a Latin square follows the formula $1, 2, n, 3, n-1, 4, n-2...$, where $n$ is the number of conditions. For subsequent rows, 1 is added to the previous and returning to 1 after $n$ \cite{experimental2}. Using this method, only four different orders are needed. This means that the first player will experience order 1, the second player order 2, etc.

\subsection{Task} \label{task}
Taking inspiration from Section \ref{marioLevel}, a questionnaire was built into the game. Before the game begins, players are asked to fill in basic demographical information. Before the game starts, participants don't know what to expect; they don't know the range of what stimuli they will see, hence, they might be hesitant to use the extreme values on the Likert scales in the questionnaire. To counter this, participants are presented with two examples of the conditions (very fast and very slow acceleration/deceleration) in a closed environment before the game begins (see Figure \ref{fig:example}). This is called \textit{anchoring} \cite{cunningham} and gives players a common reference point of of what to expect in the game. However, the game doesn't explicitly describe the two examples, i.e., stating that it's the acceleration/deceleration that change.

\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Afterwards, the game starts and players are asked to find and collect three stars. The purpose of the stars is to ensure that players move/jump around enough in order to experience the feel of controlling the ball. The stars have been placed in the beginning, middle and end of the level, so players have to experience the whole level each time. The level consists of traditional platforming elements, as well as obstacles in the form of a few moving enemies and spikes. Figure \ref{fig:level} shows an overview of the game's level.

\begin{figure*}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Pics/levelStructure}
\caption{Participants played the same level four times.}
\label{fig:level}
\end{figure*}

Each time players collect three stars, the game is paused and a questionnaire is shown (see Figure \ref{fig:questionnaire}). The questionnaire consists of three sets of questions. The first asks players to try and describe the feeling of controlling the ball on the ground and in the air, with their own words. Inspired by Section \ref{colour}, it is stressed that the chosen word(s) should be something that the player would use to describe the feeling to e.g. a friend. As in Section \ref{colour}, there are no restriction on what types of words players use (the input field's length is equivalent to approximately 66 characters, but it is possible to scroll forward/backward if a participant writes more words than this). Each input field includes five example words to give participants an idea of what could be used (see Table \ref{table:wordsExamples}). These are chosen randomly and include adjectives such as `rigid', `reduced', `slow', `dry', `mechanical' and `juicy'. Participants were asked to describe the feeling both on the ground and in air. Even though only horizontal movement is changed in the form of the acceleration and deceleration (both apply on ground and in air), there is a possibility that players perceive the game feel differently on ground and in air. Instead of trying to describe both at the same time, players are shown two input fields.

\begin{table} \centering
\scriptsize
\caption{Participants are randomly shown five words to give them an idea of what they could write themselves.}
\label{table:wordsExamples}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}

Difficult & Easy & Dry & Juicy & Mechanical\\
Automatic & Organic & Exciting & Wet & Simple\\
Complicated & Direct & Inert & Unrealistic & Light\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

After describing the game feel with the players' own words, a new set of questions are shown. Here, players are asked to rate the game feel on a 7-point Likert scale. Taking inspiration from Swink's book \cite{swink}, players rate the game feeling on how `twitchy', `fluid', `stiff', `floaty' and `responsive' they felt the controls were. Lastly, players are asked about how \textit{enjoyable}, \textit{difficult} and \textit{frustrating} it was to control the ball, as well as \textit{how much they liked} the control of the ball. In case players forget how it felt to control the ball, they can always click on the \textit{Resume Playing} button to refresh their memories before continuing with the questionnaire.

After finishing the fourth round, participants are asked to complete an online post-questionnaire. The questions here are about game feel in general. Some of the questions were: \textit{What parameters do you think changed between each round in the ball game?} and \textit{In your own words, how would you define the feel of games?}. Additionally, participants were shown six other platforming games (including \textit{Mega Man}, \textit{Super Mario Bros.}, \textit{LittleBigPlanet} and \textit{Super Meat Boy}) and asked to describe the feel of those games.

\subsection{Participants}
The game was uploaded to a server and shared on social media websites and gaming forums. The primary target were people who already play videogames; however, others were welcome to play the game as well. 
The participants were oblivious to the exact purpose and methods used in the experiment (they only knew that the research topic was about game feel, but not how this was measured).

A landing page was created where participants could choose to either play the game in their browsers or download a standalone build\footnote{The game is available here: \\ \url{http://tunnelvisiongames.com/g/GameFeel.html}.}. This landing page ensured that all of the participants read the exact same description of the experiment before beginning. A \$10 gift card for either Amazon or Steam was promised to one randomly-chosen participant. Bitly \cite{bitly} was used to keep track of incoming traffic to the website.

Whenever a player completed a round (collecting three stars and answering the questionnaire), data was  sent to an MySQL database. The data entry includes demographical information (age, gender, region, previous experience with games), parameter information (acceleration and deceleration times) and player descriptions (how players describe the game feel, and how they rate the game feel on the pre-defined scales). Target platform (web player or Windows player), player death count, average framerate and time spent on the level were also saved.

To ensure the order in the Latin square (see Section \ref{latinSection}), players were assigned a number between 1 and 4 when starting the game. This number corresponds to the sequences in Table \ref{table:latin}. This was achieved by taking modulus 4 of the total amount of players having completed the experiment and adding 1 to it. For instance, if 26 participants had played the game before entering, the next player would be assigned the sequence number (26 \% 4) + 1 = 3.
