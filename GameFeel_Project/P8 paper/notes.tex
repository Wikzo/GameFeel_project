Cultural: different interpretations of what words mean (e.g., twitchy)

Many were confused by the term game feel

Some couldn't distinguish between the different times

Likert scale not ordinal

AB test: is this more floaty than this?

Qualitative measures?

Effect of animations

Effect of other parameters (jump height)

Non-linear curves

Holistic experience: hard to isolate the influence of all factors (graphics, input device, time of day/mood, sound, attention, fatigue)

Acc/dec alone give too little information of overall game feel

Asking laymen instead of game designers

Let players tweak variables themselves and make their perfect game feel

Have to look at BOTH acc and dec; cannot just look at one axis individually
