\subsection{Modulating Acceleration and Deceleration}
Swink discussed different ways to modulate the player avatar movement in the chapter \textit{Response Metrics} \cite{swink}. Inspired by ADSR envelopes (Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release), which are often used to make electronic musical instruments mimic the sound of a mechanical instrument \cite{adsr}, he proposed the idea of using velocity modulation to change the game feel. Even if the input signal from the controller is discrete and binary (button is either pressed down or released), the software can modulate it into a continuous signal. By altering the attack and release phase (or, acceleration and deceleration), it is possible to create different game feel, as illustrated by Figures \ref{fig:adsr_stiff} and \ref{fig:adsr_loose}.

%, e.g., the sound of a pipe organ or a guitar string. This is achieved by modulating the amplitude over time.

%Inspired by Swink's discussion about \textit{Response Metrics} \cite{swink}, a 2D platforming game was developed. The game changes two types of parameters between each round: how fast the ball accelerates and how fast it decelerates when moving horizontally. Swink calls these the \textit{attack} and \textit{release} phases, or, the acceleration and deceleration of avatar movement. Hence, the velocity of the player's avatar is modulated over time, creating different types of game feel. Figures \ref{fig:adsr_stiff} and \ref{fig:adsr_loose} show two examples of the modulations proposed by Swink.


%According to Swink, when the acceleration or deceleration is very long (e.g., the avatar takes more than 100 milliseconds to be perceived to be moving), the impression of instantaneous response erodes. Even if there are small changes in the velocity, if these cannot be perceived by the player, the game might feel unresponsive \cite{swink}. This is illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:adsr}.

\end{figure}

Taking inspiration from Swink, a game was developed with this concept in mind. Two parameters change between each round: how fast the ball accelerates and how fast it decelerates (when moving horizontally). Hence, the velocity of the player's avatar is modulated over time. This means that when the player presses the movement button, the ball takes a certain amount of time before it reaches its maximum velocity. The same is applied when the player releases the button: the ball gradually slows down, until it stops.

To keep the experiment as simple as possible, only linear curves were considered for this project. Also, the decay phase was deemed unnecessary, since it wouldn't make sense for an avatar to accelerate, then decay a little, then sustain the maximum velocity.

%Depending on how big a delay there is from the player triggering an event to getting feedback, the game will gradually feel less responsive.

Two intervals were chosen, inspired by Swink's model of player perception and feedback (see Figure \ref{fig:response}). The first interval, \textit{fast}, is between 1 millisecond and 240 milliseconds (staying within the limits of real-time perception). The second interval, \textit{slow}, is from 241 milliseconds to 1500 milliseconds (see Table \ref{tab:time}). For each round in the game, the player is assigned randomly-chosen time values within the two intervals. The reason for choosing random values instead of fixed values is that it isn't perfectly clear at which exact point a game goes from feeling responsive to unresponsive (it's a gradual scale, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:response}). Instead of choosing arbitrary fixed numbers, the system randomly assigns numbers within the two intervals. Additionally, the model in Figure \ref{fig:response} depicts the perception of getting discrete feedback, e.g., pressing a button turns on a light bulb after 50 milliseconds. In the case of avatar movement, there is a continuous stream of feedback while the player is holding down the movement button, since the avatar is gradually moving forward (in this game, the player controls a rolling ball). However, if the acceleration/deceleration time values are very big, the avatar will take some time before it gathers a velocity that can be perceived by the player. In other words, the values change the total amount of time it takes from when a player presses a button to when the avatar reaches its maximum velocity (or, when releasing the button, reaches a velocity of zero). The acceleration/deceleration is thus scaled depending on the time values, using Equation \ref{eq:erl}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:erl} %% source: http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/physics/velocity_a_t.php
a = (v - v_0)/{\Delta}t
\end{equation} 
where $a$ is the acceleration/deceleration, $v$ is the target velocity, $v_0$ is the initial velocity and ${\Delta}t$ is the time after which the target velocity is reached.

\end{table}

The game features other parameters, such as gravity, jump velocity and the aforementioned ``ghost jump", but only the horizontal ground acceleration and deceleration changed between rounds.

The game was developed using the Unity game engine, which allows for exporting to both web and standalone platforms. The game was released for web\footnote{Unity recently made it possible to export to the WebGL platform, but at the time of writing there are bugs and performance issues, so it was chosen to use the standard web player using a browser plug-in.} and Windows. It's a traditional 2D side-scrolling platform game in which players move a small soccer ball from left to right to collect three stars (see Figure \ref{fig:game}). The game is controlled with the arrow keys and the spacebar. Similar to \textit{Super Mario Bros.}, there is a variable jump, meaning that holding down the button results in higher jumps.

Graphics and sound effects have been held to a minimum, since the influence of polishing effects (see Section \ref{polishSection}) is outside the scope of this project. Only a small trail renderer is attached to the ball. The ball also has a rolling animation that is linearly mapped to the horizontal velocity. The level has been designed to be simple and not too challenging.

To ensure that all participants had comparable experiences, the game was fixed at a 960x600 resolution, no matter if played in a browser or as a standalone program. Also, the camera is set to follow the player avatar directly; however, small deadzones for vertical and horizontal movement were implemented, meaning that the camera will only move when the player moves outside these zones (e.g., by jumping more than a few pixels).
