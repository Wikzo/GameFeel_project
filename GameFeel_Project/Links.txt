University project about game feel - help me by playing this game

Hi,

I am currently doing a university project on the topic of game feel.

I have created a small 2D platforming game that I would like you to play, and then answer some simple questions.

As a token of appreciation, one randomly-chosen participant will win a $10 gift card for Amazon or Steam.

All you have to do is go to [url=http://bit.ly/1HcUbXl]this link[/url] and either play the game in your browser (requires Unity web plugin) or download the file to your computer (Windows only).

Thanks a lot in advance! :)
